% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).

% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should

% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the

\begin{abstract}
How to mine complex and useful knowledge from an attributed graph? For many real world data, consider e.g. social networks, we do not only have a graph representing e.g. the friendship network, but also a lot of additional attributes further characterizing the nodes, e.g. information on hobbies, gender, location, etc. Some techniques for clustering such complex data have recently been proposed. However, existing algorithms suffer the drawbacks that they either require many input parameters which are difficult to estimate, or they only recognize the overlap in the graph structure or in the attributes of the nodes but not in both. With overlap we mean that nodes as well as attributes might be assigned to multiple different clusters.
Avoiding overlap implies  losing information. For that reason we propose a method that enables combined overlap in both the underlying network structure and the attribute subspaces of each node. But allowing that much overlap raises another challenge: How to handle redundancy? 
As solution this paper proposes a non-redundant method called IROC (for \emph{I}nformation-theoretic non-\emph{R}edundant \emph{O}verlapping \emph{C}lustering) that evaluates complex attributed graphs in an  automatic way. We are the first that emphasize the importance of mining overlapping communities in all aspects of an attributed graph. Our experiments show that IROC reveals meaningful information in both real world - and synthetic data sets.
